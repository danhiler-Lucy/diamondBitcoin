                                        At Diamonds Of Botswana, we understand that our customers care where their diamonds come from and we share
that concern with you. Every diamond we sell is certified conflict-free, assuring you that our inventory was procured
through legal sources. In compliance with the Patriot Act, the Kimberley Process, and various United Nations
resolutions, the diamonds we sell have been obtained using legitimate means. Further, our internal guidelines
exceed government requirements: we have binding contracts with our suppliers which guarantee that the diamonds
they offer to us for sale are conflict-free. We do not purchase polished diamonds from sources which are not
members of the professional diamond trade.

BLOOD DIAMONDS – FINANCING DEATH AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION
</div>
Conflict-free diamonds are those gems which were not obtained in association with human rights abuses, child labor,
violence, or environmental degradation. Although the United Nation’s Kimberley Process only covers diamonds
under the control of legitimate and recognized governments, conflict-free goes one step further by rejecting
diamonds from governments that trade in diamonds to bankroll their conflicts. Throughout the 1990s, most of the
world’s diamonds came from Africa, particularly regions undergoing civil unrest. Rebel armies in parts of Africa
were exploiting alluvial diamond fields to fund their wars against established governments, putting people and the
environment in the middle of their conflicts. Alluvial diamonds are found just inches to a few feet below the surface,
making them easier to mine, but having an adverse impact on the environment. The people working these fields
were often very young and subject to exploitation, with some losing their lives or becoming permanently maimed as
wars raged around them. Hence, the term blood diamonds came into being to describe these types of gems.
<div class="contentSectionDescTitleBold">
 

KIMBERLEY COMPLIANT AND AMERICA’S PATRIOT ACT
</div>
The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) was established to certify the origin of rough diamonds from
sources known to be conflict-free. A 2000 meeting of southern African diamond producing countries established
guidelines for the KPCS, which were later adopted by the United Nations. To ensure compliance, independent
auditing systems are tasked with tracking diamonds from their place of origin to delivery. Polished diamonds sold in
the U.S. must adhere to the Patriot Act which requires that every U.S. dealer maintain Kimberley compliance or be
subject to penalties from Homeland Security, the U.S. Justice Department, and the U.S. Treasury.
